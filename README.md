Ever wanted to lead some thoughts? Ever led thoughts BEFORE they become popular and you wish you had gotten credit for it? This repo is for you!

### Rules
Let's try to predict the thoughtleading terms of the year!! The rules are simple, PR your name and your top 1-3 terms to win.
The prize? A Thoughtleader certificate AND the admiration of your peers for any term submitted before a known record of it that makes it to industry lingo.
