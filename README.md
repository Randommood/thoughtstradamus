Ever wanted to lead some thoughts? Ever led thoughts BEFORE they become popular and you wish you had gotten credit for it? This repo is for you!

### Rules
Let's pick the terms for 2018!! The rules are simple, PR your name and your top 5-10 terms for the next year. Prizes and conditions apply. Mostly you win the satisfaction and admiration of your peers for any term submitted before a known record of it that makes it to industry lingo. Some discussion in [issue 1](https://github.com/Randommood/thoughtstradamus/issues/1).

Check out our [2017's leading thoughts](2017_thoughts.md)!!
